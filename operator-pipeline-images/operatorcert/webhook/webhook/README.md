# Webhook client library
IBM Webhook Client Library is used to trigger the IBM webhook. It's sourced from the externally maintained repository
https://github.com/redhat-marketplace/pipeline-mirroring/tree/main/client/python
which we do not expect to be updated.
As such, they are excluded from the unit tests.
