# Community pipeline secrets usage

## Editing secrets
The community pipeline uses a HashiCorp vault collection to store secrets.
Adding new secrets can be achieved using this [guide][1]. If you need to edit
secrets in the community-pipeline collection, you need to ask a maintainer for
access. Note that you can only be added if you have logged in to the [vault
system][3] at least once. After the access is granted, log into the [vault][4]
itself using the OIDC method.

## Collection usage

The collection is mounted into the prow job configuration ([example][2]) as
such:
```yaml
...
- mount_path: /var/run/cred
  name: community-pipeline-github-automation
  namespace: test-credentials
...
```

The secret can then be used in the prow job script. An example with a github
token:
```sh
$ test -f /var/run/cred/operator_bundle_bot_github_token # test if secret exists
$ echo $?
0
$ curl -L -I \
    -u operator-bundle-bot:$(cat /var/run/cred/operator_bundle_bot_github_token) \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
    -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
