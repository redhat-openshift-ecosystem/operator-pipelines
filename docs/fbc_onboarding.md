# File Based Catalog onboarding

Operators in certified, marketplace, or community repositories are defined in a declarative way.
This means a user provides all necessary information in advance about the operator bundle and how it
should be released in a catalog and OPM automation injects a bundle into the correct place
in the upgrade path.

This is however very limited solution that doesn't allow any further modification of upgrade
paths after a bundle is already released. Due to this limitation, a concept
of FBC (File-based catalog) is now available and allows users to modify the operator upgrade
path in a separate step without the need to release a new bundle.

To enable FBC for a given operator the operator owner needs to convert
existing operator into FBC format.

We want to help with this process and we prepared a tooling that helps with this transition.

## Convert existing operator to FBC
As a prerequisite to this process, you need to install a few dependencies.

```bash
# Go to the operator repo directory (certified-operators, marketplace-operators, community-operators-prod)
cd certified-operators

# Install a migration script
pip install git+https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/operator-pipelines.git

# Download opm cli tool
curl -sL https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/releases/download/v1.39.0/linux-amd64-opm -o opm && \
chmod +x opm && mv opm ~/.local/bin
```

Now we can convert existing operator into FBC. The initial run takes a while because
a local cache is generated during a run.

The script will execute the following steps:
 - Fetch a list of currently supported OCP catalogs
 - Transform existing catalogs into a basic template
 - Generate a composite template for an operator
 - Generate an FBC catalog for a given operator
 - Update operator ci.yaml config

The following examples will be using `aqua` operator as an example. Change an operator name that matches the operator you want to convert.
```bash
$ fbc-onboarding --operator-name aqua \
 --repo-root . \
 --verbose

2024-04-24 15:53:05,537 [operator-cert] INFO Generating FBC templates for the following versions: ['4.12', '4.13', '4.14', '4.15', '4.16']
2024-04-24 15:53:07,632 [operator-cert] INFO Processing catalog: v4.12
2024-04-24 15:53:07,633 [operator-cert] DEBUG Building cache for registry.stage.redhat.io/redhat/community-operator-index:v4.12
...
```

After a script is finished you should see a template and generated fbc in the repository.
```bash
$ tree operatos/aqua

operators/aqua
├── 0.0.1
...
├── catalogs.yaml
├── catalog-templates
│   ├── v4.12.yaml
│   ├── v4.13.yaml
│   ├── v4.14.yaml
│   ├── v4.15.yaml
│   └── v4.16.yaml
├── ci.yaml
└── composite-config.yaml
```
... and File-based catalog in `catalogs` directory
```bash
$ tree catalogs
catalogs

│   └── aqua
│       └── catalog.yaml
├── v4.13
│   └── aqua
│       └── catalog.yaml

├── v4.15
│   └── aqua
│       └── catalog.yaml
└── v4.16
    └── aqua
        └── catalog.yaml

```

## Submit FBC changes
Artifacts generated in the previous step need to be added to a git and submitted via pull request. The operator pipeline validates the content of the catalogs and releases changes into ocp catalogs.

```bash
$ git add operators/aqua/{catalog-templates,catalogs.yaml,composite-config.yaml,ci.yaml}

$ git add
$ git add catalogs/{v4.12,v4.13,v4.14,v4.15,v4.16}/aqua

$ git commit --signoff -m "Add FBC resources for aqua operator"
```

## Generating catalogs from templates
Catalog templates are used to simplify a view of a catalog and allow easier manipulation of catalogs. The automated conversion pre-generates a basic + composite template that can be turned into full FBC using the following command:

```bash
opm alpha render-template composite -f catalogs.yaml -c composite-config.yaml
```

Of course, you can choose any type of template that you prefer. More information about catalog templates can be found [here](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/reference/catalog-templates/)
