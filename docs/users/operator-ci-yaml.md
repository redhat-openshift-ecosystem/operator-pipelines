# Operator Publishing / Review settings

Each operator might have `ci.yaml` configuration file to be present in an operator directory (for example `operators/aqua/ci.yaml`). This configuration file is used by [community-operators](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/community-operators-prod) pipeline to setup various features like `reviewers` or `operator versioning`.

> **Note:**
    One can create or modify `ci.yaml` file with a new operator version. This operation can be done in the same PR with other operator changes.

## Reviewers

> **Note:**
    This option is only valid for community operators. The certified or marketplace reviewer are configure using Red Hat Connect.

If you want to accelerate publishing your changes, consider adding yourself and others you trust to the `reviewers` list. If the author of PR will be in that list, changes she/he made will be taken as authorized changes. This will be the indicator for our pipeline that the PR is ready to merge automatically.

> **Note:**
    If an author of PR is not in `reviewers` list or not in `ci.yaml` on `main` branch, PR will not be merged automatically.

> **Note:**
    If an author of PR is not in `reviewers` list and `reviewers` are present in `ci.yaml` file. All `reviewers` will be mentioned in PR comment to check for upcoming changes.

For this to work, it is required to setup reviewers in `ci.yaml` file. It can be done by adding `reviewers` tag with a list of GitHub usernames. For example

### Example
```
$ cat <path-to-operator>/ci.yaml
---
reviewers:
  - user1
  - user2

```

## Operator versioning
Operators have multiple versions. When a new version is released, OLM can update an operator automatically. There are 2 update strategies possible, which are defined in `ci.yaml` at the operator top level.

### replaces-mode
Every next version defines which version will be replaced using `replaces` key in the CSV file. It means, that there is a possibility to omit some versions from the *update graph*. The best practice is to put them in a separate channel then.

### semver-mode
Every version will be replaced by the next higher version according to semantic versioning.

### Restrictions
A contributor can decide if `semver-mode` or `replaces-mode` mode will be used for a specific operator. By default, `replaces-mode` is activated, when `ci.yaml` file is present and contains `updateGraph: replaces-mode`. When a contributor decides to switch and use `semver-mode`, it will be specified in `ci.yaml` file or the key `updateGraph` will be missing.

### Example
```
$ cat <path-to-operator>/ci.yaml
---
# Use `replaces-mode` or `semver-mode`.
updateGraph: replaces-mode
```

## Kubernetes max version in CSV

Starting from kubernetes 1.22 some old APIs were deprecated ([Deprecated API Migration Guide from v1.22](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-22). Users can set `operatorhub.io/ui-metadata-max-k8s-version: "<version>"` in its CSV file to inform its maximum supported Kubernetes version. The following example will inform that operator can handle `1.21` as maximum Kubernetes version
```
$ cat <path-to-operators>/<name>/<version>/.../my.clusterserviceversion.yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    operatorhub.io/ui-metadata-max-k8s-version: "1.21"
```
