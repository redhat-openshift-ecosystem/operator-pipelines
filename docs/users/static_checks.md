# Static check
The operator pipelines want to make sure the operator that will be released to
OpenShift operator catalog follows a best practices and meet certain standards
that we expect from an operator.

In order to meet these standards a series of static checks have been created for
each stream of operators. The static checks are executed for each operator
submission and reports warning or failures with an description of what is wrong
and suggestion on how to fix it.


Here is the example how the result will look like in the PR:

## ISV tests

#### check_pruned_graph (Warning)
This test make sure the operator update graph is not accidentally pruned by
introducing operator configuration that prunes graph as a unwanted side effect.

The unintentional graph pruning happens when olm.skipRange annotation is set
but replaces field is not set in the CSV. The definition may lead to unintentional
[pruning of the update graph](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/concepts/olm-architecture/operator-catalog/creating-an-update-graph/#skiprange).

If this is intentional, you can skip the check
by adding `/test skip check_pruned_graph` comment to a pull request.

#### check_marketplace_annotation
The marketplace operators requires additional metadata in order to be properly
displayed in the Marketplace ecosystem.

There are 2 required fields in the operator `clusterserviceversion` that need
to be filled and need to have specific value:

- `metadata.annotations.marketplace.openshift.io/remote-workflow`
    - Value template: `https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us/operators/{annotation_package}/pricing?utm_source=openshift_console`
- `metadata.annotations.marketplace.openshift.io/support-workflow`
    - Value template: `https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us/operators/{annotation_package}/support?utm_source=openshift_console`

Where `{annotation_package}` matches `operators.operatorframework.io.bundle.package.v1`
from `metadata/annotation.yaml` file.

The test is only executed for operators submitted inside the [Red Hat marketplace repo](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/redhat-marketplace-operators).

## Community tests

#### check_osdk_bundle_validate_operatorhub
The test is based on `operator-sdk bundle validate` command with `name=operatorhub` test suite [(link)](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/cli/operator-sdk_bundle_validate/#operator-sdk-bundle-validate).

#### check_osdk_bundle_validate_operator_framework
The test is based on `operator-sdk bundle validate` command with `suite=operatorframework` test suite [(link)](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/cli/operator-sdk_bundle_validate/#operator-sdk-bundle-validate).

#### check_required_fields
| Field name | Validation | Description |
|------------|------------|------|
| `spec.displayName` | `.{3,50}` | A string with 3 - 50 characters |
| `spec.description` | `.{20,}` | A bundle description with at least 20 characters |
| `spec.icon` | `media` | A valid base64 content with a supported media type (`{"base64data": <b64 content>, "mediatype": enum["image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/gif", "image/svg+xml"]}`) |
| `spec.version` | `SemVer` | Valid semantic version |
| `spec.maintainers` |  | At least 1 maintainer contacts. Example: `{"name": "User 123", "email": "user@redhat.com"}` |
| `spec.provider.name` | `.{3,}` | A string with at least 3 characters |
| `spec.links` |  | At least 1 link. Example: `{"name": "Documentation", "url": "https://redhat.com"}` |

#### check_dangling_bundles
The test prevents from releasing an operator and keeping any previous bundle dangling.
A dangling bundle is a bundle that is not referenced by any other bundle and is
not a HEAD of a channel.

In the example bellow the `v1.3` bundle is dangling.
```mermaid
graph LR
    A(v1.0) -->B(v1.1)
    B --> C(v1.2)
    B --> E(v1.3)
    C --> D(v1.4 - HEAD)
```
#### check_api_version_constraints
The test verifies a consistency between value `com.redhat.openshift.versions` from
annotation with `spec.minKubeVersion`. In case a an operator targets specific version
of OpenShift and at the same time sets minimal kube version that is higher than
the one supported by the OCP. The test raises an error.

Example:

Following combination is not valid since the OCP 4.9 is based on 1.22 Kubernetes.

```
spec.minKubeVersion: 1.23

com.redhat.openshift.versions: 4.9-4.15
```
#### check_upgrade_graph_loop

The purpose of this test is to check whether there are any loops in the upgrade graph.

As stated on the graph below the edge between `v1.2` and `v1.0` introduces
a loop in the graph.
```mermaid
graph LR
    A(v1.0) -->B(v1.1)
    B --> C(v1.2)
    C --> D(v1.3)
    C --> A
```
#### check_replaces_availability
The test aims to verify if a bundle referenced by the `replaces` value is available in all
catalog version where the given bundle is going to be released to. The list of
catalog version is determined by the `com.redhat.openshift.versions` annotation if present.
If the annotation is not present the bundle targets all supported ocp version.

To fix the issue either change a range of versions where a bundle is going to be
released by updating the annotation or change the `replaces` value.
#### check_operator_name_unique
The test makes sure the operator is consistent when using operator names as defined
in the `clusterserviceversion`. It is not allowed to have multiple bundle names for
a single operator. The source of the value is at `csv.metadata.name`.
#### check_ci_upgrade_graph
The test verifies a content of the `ci.yaml` file and make sure only allowed values are
used for `updateGraph` key. The currently supported values are: `["replaces-mode", "semver-mode"]`.

## Common tests

#### check_operator_name (Warning)
The test verifies a consistency between operator name annotation and operator
name in the CSV definition. The source of these values are:

 - `operators.operatorframework.io.bundle.package.v1` (`metadata/annotation.yaml`)
 - `csv.metadata.name` - the name without a version (`manifests/.*.clusterserviceversion.yaml`)
